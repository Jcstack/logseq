This Clojure style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Clojure
programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Clojure
programmers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage gets used, and a
style guide that holds to an ideal that has been rejected by the people it is
supposed to help risks not getting used at all -- no matter how good it is.

The guide is separated into several sections of related rules. I've
tried to add the rationale behind the rules (if it's omitted, I've
assumed that it's pretty obvious).

I didn't come up with all the rules out of nowhere; they are mostly
based on my extensive career as a professional software engineer,
feedback and suggestions from members of the Clojure community, and
various highly regarded Clojure programming resources, such as
http://www.clojurebook.com/["Clojure Programming"]
and http://joyofclojure.com/["The Joy of Clojure"].

NOTE: The guide is still a work in progress; some sections are missing,
others are incomplete, some rules are lacking examples, some rules
don't have examples that illustrate them clearly enough. In due time
these issues will be addressed -- just keep them in mind for now.
Help us address those shortcomings and make this guide better together!

Please note, that the Clojure developing community maintains a list of
https://clojure.org/community/contrib_howto#_coding_guidelines[coding standards for libraries],
too.
